Hi! I’m **Savion Watson**, a student at the _College of Staten Island_ through the Macaulay Honor’s Scholarship. 

I started programming in a three-year software engineering intensive from High School. I also worked in my high school's IT department and as a tutor for my college. 

I have experience in **React**, **Bootstrap5**, **Unity**, **Python**, **Javascript**, and **C++** . 

I specialize in Web Development, but am also passionate for Data Science and Game Development.
