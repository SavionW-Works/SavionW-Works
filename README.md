Hi! I’m Savion Watson, a student at the College of Staten Island through the Macaulay Honor’s Scholarship. 

I started programming in a three-year software engineering intensive from Ralph R McKee High School. I also interned in the school's IT department for two years before graduation. 

I am currentlyspecializing in Web Develop through my college courses, but like to dip into game development in my spare time.
