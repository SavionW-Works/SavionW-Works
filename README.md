Hi! I’m **Savion Watson**, a student at the _College of Staten Island_ through the Macaulay Honor’s Scholarship. 

I started programming in a three-year software engineering intensive from Ralph R McKee High School. I also interned in the school's IT department for two years before graduation. 

I have experience in **React**, **Bootstrap5**, **Python** for Data Science and Data Structures, **C++** and **Unity**. 

I'm currently specializing in Web Development, but am also passionate for Data Science and Game Development.
