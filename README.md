Hi! I’m Savion, a student at the College of Staten Island through the Macaulay Honor’s Scholarship. 

I started programming in three-year software engineering intensive from my high school. I also interned in the IT department for two years before graduation. 

Currently learning C++ and Python but like to dip into game development with Unity when I have the chance.
