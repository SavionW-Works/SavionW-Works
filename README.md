Hi! I’m Savion Watson, a student at the College of Staten Island through the Macaulay Honor’s Scholarship. 

I started programming in a three-year software engineering intensive from Ralph R McKee High School. I also interned in the school's IT department for two years before graduation. 

I have experience in Python for Data Science and Data Structures, C++ for intermediate programming, and C# for Game Development. 

I'm currently specializing in Web Development, but am also passionate for Data Science and Game Development.
